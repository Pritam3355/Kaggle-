# List of Notebooks 
1. Predicting News sentiments of by using word embedding created using Word2Vec model. The model is efficient in terms of training 
   time . Considering the number of records & variety of record on which the model was trained , it performs at it's best .
   I've performed some text processing to capture the variance which in turns have provided some interesting analysis result on 
   market reaction to a certain kind of news article

2. Predicting Life expectancy using WHO record . Here the new feature selection & feature engineering has been done manually. 
   As a result simple linear regrssion produces a r2 score (i.e The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is 
   predictable from the independent variables) is above 98% . Here I've done mostly statistical analysis methods rather than
   pre-build library functions
